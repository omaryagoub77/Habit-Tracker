Build a production-ready mobile habit tracker app (Android first, iOS compatible).
This is NOT a web app.

App Name

HabitFlow

Tech Stack (MANDATORY)

Expo (managed workflow)

React Native

TypeScript

Expo Router (file-based routing)

Expo SQLite (local persistent storage)

Expo Notifications (local notifications & alarms)

Expo Dev Client / Standalone build compatible

No web-only APIs

No Expo Go limitations

Core Requirements (DO NOT SKIP ANY)
1. App Structure

Use Expo Router with this structure:

app/
 ├─ _layout.tsx
 ├─ index.tsx            // Landing / Today screen
 ├─ habits/
 │   ├─ new.tsx          // Create habit
 │   └─ edit/[id].tsx
 ├─ check.tsx            // Daily habit check screen
 ├─ reports.tsx          // Calendar & stats
 ├─ task.tsx             // One-time task + alarm
 └─ settings.tsx
src/
 ├─ database/
 │   └─ DatabaseService.ts
 ├─ models/
 ├─ services/
 │   └─ NotificationService.ts
 └─ components/

2. Landing Page (HOME / TODAY)

This is the main screen.

Features:

Display today’s habits only

Group habits into sections:

Morning

Midday

Evening

Night

Each habit has:

Checkbox (checked / unchecked)

Name

Optional icon

Small floating “+” button

Navigates to Create Habit

Checking a habit:

Saves today’s completion in the database

Updates UI instantly

If already checked today → persist state

3. Habit Creation

Habit fields:

Name

Time section (Morning / Midday / Evening / Night)

Optional reminder time

Optional icon / color

Start date

Active toggle

Behavior:

Saved in SQLite

Optional notification scheduled daily

Cannot crash if DB is not initialized

4. Daily Check Logic (CRITICAL)

Habit completion is per day

Store:

habitId

date (YYYY-MM-DD)

completed (boolean)

Prevent duplicate entries per day

Allow unchecking (updates record)

5. Reports Page (CALENDAR STYLE)
Requirements:

Calendar view (month grid)

Each day:

Colored if habits were completed

Different intensity if all vs partial

Tap a day:

Show list of habits completed that day

Summary:

Streak per habit

Completion percentage

6. One-Time Task Page (VERY IMPORTANT)

This page is separate from habits.

Features:

Create one single task

Fields:

Title

Date

Time

Alarm notification:

Fires at exact time

Task auto-expires after completion or time passed

Must work in standalone build, not Expo Go

Ability to delete / cancel notification

7. Notifications (NO EXPO GO LIMITS)

Use expo-notifications

Request permissions correctly

Schedule:

Daily habit reminders

One-time task alarms

Store notification IDs in database

Cancel notifications when habit/task is deleted

8. Database (MANDATORY STABILITY)

SQLite tables:

habits

habit_completions

one_time_tasks

Rules:

Initialize DB before any query

Singleton DatabaseService

Safe async initialization

No “Database not initialized” errors

All CRUD wrapped in try/catch

9. Navigation

Bottom tab navigation:

Today

Check

Reports

Task

Settings

No navigation errors

All routes registered

10. UI / UX

Mobile-first design

Clean, minimal UI

Touch-friendly

No web layouts

Use React Native components only

11. Build & Environment

Must run on Android emulator or real device

Compatible with:

npx expo prebuild
npx expo run:android
npx eas build --profile development


No in-memory storage

No mock data after setup

12. Error Handling

Graceful error messages

No silent failures

Console logs for debugging

13. What NOT to Do

Do NOT build a web app

Do NOT rely on Expo Go for notifications

Do NOT skip database initialization

Do NOT mix task and habit logic

Final Deliverable

A fully working native mobile habit tracker app with:

Today habit tracking

Time-based habit sections

Daily checking

Calendar reports

One-time task with alarm

Local persistence

Real notifications

Build it cleanly, correctly, and completely.
